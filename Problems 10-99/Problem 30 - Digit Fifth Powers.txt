Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44
8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84
9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44
As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

--------------------------------

First, an upper bound. It's not infinity. 9^5 is five digits long. 9^6 has 6 digits. 9^7 has six digits.
So, no number of this form can have more than 6 digits. The limit is 999999. 
But, we can get a strong upper bound. The maximum sum of fifth powers of six digits is 6 x 9^5. That is the upper bound set for this problem.

Secondly, I got another one of those familiar overflow errors because I had underestimated the number of solutions. So, I was getting junk values to the answer.
That got resolved when I increased the size of the solution vector.

Thirdly, build a hash table (cache) of fifth powers of all single digits so it doesn't have to be calculated each time.
I did this in a somewhat fancy way. n^5 = n^2 x n^2 x n

So, T(n) -> n x n; Then T(n) -> T(n) x T(n); Then, T(n) = T(n) x n

It uses three multiplications rather than four for n x n x n x n x n.

Apart from that, just comb through the search space linearly and get the sum of the fifth powers of the digits using the hash table.

1       4150    4151    54748   92727   93084   194979
The sum of these numbers is 443840.

Project Euler discounts 1 so just subtract 1 from this answer.
