2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

---------------------------------

I didn't need to write a program to do this. It's very simple with one mathematical insight. Think of the numbers as products of primes.
A number m | n iff all of the prime factors of m also divide n.

So, for all the numbers from 1-20 to divide a number, it simply has to be divisible by all the highest  prime powers within 20.

N = 2^4 x 3^2 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 19
= 232792560	

We know that N is divisible by every number from 1 to 20, because it is possible to arrange the factors of N = d x N', 
where d is any integer from 1 - 20 and N' = N/d.

Any d's prime factorisation can be gotten from the prime factors of N.

We know that N is the smallest such number, because on removing any factor from it, 
there will be at least one integer d, from 1 - 20 who's prime factors we can no longer find.

For example, if we remove a 2, N is no longer divisible by 16.

I suppose that if I wrote a program, I would 

First find all the primes less than target. Using some Sieve. Preferably the Sieve of Sunduram, optimised because it is my favourite one of late.

2. Run a loop to find the highest power of each prime that is smaller than target. I wouldn't use logarithms because it's a bit too expensive.

3. Store the highest index of each prime smaller than target in another parallel array.

4. Even for small numbers like 30, there would be overflow. So, I suppose I could just display the number as a product of each prime to the appropriate index as my answer.
Like how I wrote N over here.
