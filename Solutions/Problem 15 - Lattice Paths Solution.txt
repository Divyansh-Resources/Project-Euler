How many paths are there from the top-right to the bottom-left corner of a 20x20 grid, allowning only down and right movements ?

No programming was necessary to solve this. It requires the insight of constructing a bijection in between a path and a string. 
Every path uniquely corresponds to a string of length 40, and has 20 occurences of R and D each.
To go from the top-right to bottom-left corner, it is necessary to go down exactly 20 times and go right exactly 20 times. 
The different paths correspond to the differnt orders in which these movements are taken.

\frac{40!}{20! 20!} = 137846528820
