It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2×12
15 = 7 + 2×22
21 = 3 + 2×32
25 = 7 + 2×32
27 = 19 + 2×22
33 = 31 + 2×12

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?

-----------------------

Well, obviously, it will be too difficult to run through all the odd integers, check if it is prime or composite. 
If it is composite, run through all smaller odd integers, take the difference divide by 2 and check if the square root is an integer.600
This brute force approach is inelegant and not practical.

Here's what I did.

1. Partitioned the odd integers (upto an arbitrary limit since computers don't understand infinity) into two classes - prime and composite.
 I used the Sieve of Sunduram because it generates the odd primes. I modified it a bit to get the odd composites as well. 
 Additionally, this Sieve only operates from 1 to limit/2 to produce the full list of odd primes and odd composites from 1 to limit.

2. Then, I ran through the odd integers, squared each one (till the squares were smaller than the same limit) and then marked the squares.

3. Then, I went through the list of composites. 
After picking a composite q, I considered (q - p)/2 for all primes p smaller than q and checked if it was a square.
If it was, then I set a flag to one. The flag was one when q was chosen.
Display the first q which doesn't raise the flag.

This was also my first program where I linked different files (and got it to work). I linked three files together ! The first and second step are two different files.

Answer is 5777. I guess the program would run a lot faster if I set the limit at 6,000 instead of 50,000. The time appears to come down by half from 840ms to 430ms.
I ran the program to display all numbers from 1 to 50,000. I expected there to be hundred such numbers. Interestingly, there were only 2 - 5777 and 5993.
For some reason, these two numbers occur quite close by to each other but very distant from any other such number (if there are any more). 
I can see why the conjecture stood now.

After optimizing the Sieve of Sunduram, I have gotten it down to 30ms ! The terminal screen says it took 30 ms, but the function I put in the program to read time 
says 12-14 ms.
