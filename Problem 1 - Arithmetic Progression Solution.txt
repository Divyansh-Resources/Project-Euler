If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

It's very straightforward. No computer code required. Use the formula for arithmetic progression. The only stumbling block here is that 1000 shouldn't 
be added because they mean strictly less than 1000.

Answer is 23168
